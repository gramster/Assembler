An assembler and linker for a RISC processor. When I started my Masters
in 1986 the plan was that we would build this chip and implement UNIX on it.
I did the instruction set design and wrote the assembler and linker. Someone
else was supposed to do the silicon in an industry partnership, but they
dropped out and the project was cancelled. 

I used what I learned to create an assmebler for 80386, also included here.
Note that I don't remember what state the latter is in, and if it is complete
or not.
